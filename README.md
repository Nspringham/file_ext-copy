# file_ext-copy
Find all files of a single extension and copy to designated directory.
You will be prompted to enter a file extenson type (pdf, txt, py, etc) 
followed by the name of the directory you want all the files to be copied to.

- Thinking of entering a switch that allows you to choose between copying & moving the chosen files
- This will be done using a if statement and another user input prompt
- Need to include an exception for when you can not create a file when that file already exists
- Need to include a time taken, number of files moved and size of folder.
